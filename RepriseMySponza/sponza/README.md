# Sponza

A small C++ library to expose the Sponza geometry model as a 3d scene with
basic lighting and materials for use by graphics programming students.

## Getting Started

### Obtaining

The project can be obtained from the git repository located at
https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/sponza.git, for example:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/tpdavison/sponza.git
```

However, the project is usually embedded in other projects as a git submodule.

### What's Included

```
sponza/
|-- doc/
|-- include/
|-- res/
|-- src/
```

The root directory contains the necessary configuration files.

The `doc` directory contains any documentation or configuration files for
redistribution to client programmers.

The `include` directory contains the public header files for redistribution to
client programmers.

The `res` directory contains the runtime data files for redistribution to
client programmers.

The `src` directory contains the source code (including any private headers)
for the project.

### Using

The project is designed to be used as a dependent project within a parent
Visual Studio solution, producing a lib file to be linked against.

The project will build its lib files into a directory structure under a `build`
sub-directory in the solution directory.

For easy embedding within a parent solution, ensure the other projects in the
solution are using the `tdk.props`, `tdk.targets` and `sponza.lib.props`
configuration files by copying them into the various project directories and
including the following at the appropriate location in their `vcxproj` files:

```
<Import Project="tdk.props" />
<Import Project="tdk.targets" />
```

Sponza is dependent upon the following libraries:

* TCF: available from https://scma-intranet.tees.ac.uk/users/u0018196/tdk/tcf.zip

The library files should be added into the appropriate location in the following
directory structure under the parent solution directory.

```
external\
|-- bin\
|   |-- Win32\
|   |-- x64\
|-- doc\
|-- include\
|   |-- tcf\
|-- lib\
    |-- Win32\
	|-- x64\
```

Dynamic library files (DLLs) should be placed in the appropriate sub-directory
of the `bin` directory.
